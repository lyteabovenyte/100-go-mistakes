# 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Source code and community space of 📖 _100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them_, published by Manning in August 2022. + a lot of changes on the files and test cases as any implementation of the actual source code can be found by around several different approaches here and it's not specific to just one package 🌚 and I'm trying every package and as long as the example allows me, every method. so alter not to be confused.

#### Important Notice:
##### this repo is my <u>playground</u> of learning Go by mistakes (as the book's title says) so any file and folder may contain some changes which could be useful for you but also maybe confusing as I'm just trying methods, interfaces and packages out. 
##### Also I added a notes markdown on the root of the project to grab notes while browsing the whole Go packages and the actual implementation on the golang's source code. take a look if interested 🍻
